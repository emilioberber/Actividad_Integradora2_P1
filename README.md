**Project Overview:**

The project "Connectivity Networks on Human Brain" conducted a comprehensive investigation into brain activity during cognitive tasks, utilizing EEG (Electroencephalogram) technology. Employing various Python-based neuroinformatics techniques, the project aimed to understand the intricate connectivity patterns within the human brain.

**Project Phases:**

**Phase 1: Graph Visualization**
- Initial visualization of brain activity data.

**Phase 2: Graph Traversal**
- Employed Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Uniform Cost Search algorithms to explore efficient paths between electrodes.
- Conducted BFS/DFS with 32 electrodes.
- Implemented the Floyd method to calculate minimum distances between all electrode pairs.

**Phase 3: Minimum Spanning Trees**
- Identified vertices of Minimum Spanning Trees.
- Generated graphical representations of Minimum Spanning Trees.

**Phase 4: Convex Hull**
- Determined convex hulls and visualized them through graphical representations.

**Phase 5: Voronoi Diagrams**
- Constructed Voronoi diagrams to visually represent vertex degrees.
- Optional: Highlighted circles at the origin.
- Facilitated the analysis of brain connectivity patterns.
